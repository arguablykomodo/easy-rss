# Easy RSS

Are you an avid consumer of internet media? Are you frustrated by the lack of a consistent way of getting notifications for the content that you love? If you answer yes to any of these questions, then RSS feeds are the solution for you!

There is _one_ problem i didn't mention...

RSS feeds are an old technology straight from the 90s, and because of that most RSS readers and managers look like they are from the same era.

That's why i made Easy RSS! The RSS manager for the common internet denizen! This stylish and modern RSS manager takes all the simplicity of the RSS format, and incorporates it into a modern and stylish design to create an easy to use but still powerful piece of software.

Easy RSS includes features such as:

- Synchronizing your YouTube subscriptions, so you no longer have to worry about a spooky algorithm controlling what you see (say goodbye to "hitting that bell")
- Importing and exporting your feeds to and from other RSS readers, so that you can easily transition to RSS reader (and I guess you can also transition to another reader, but I shouldn't say that if I want people to use my extension)
- An easy and simple to understand modern UI that makes sure you are never lost in settings pages and Windows XP-esque dialogs

## Building

1. Make sure you have yarn installed
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dist`
4. Enjoy the compiled code in the `dist` folder and the extension .zip file in `web-ext-artifacts`!
5. ...
6. Profit!
